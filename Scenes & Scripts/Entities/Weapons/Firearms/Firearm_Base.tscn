This is a WIELDABLE weapon only meant to be handled by the Player.
Enemies get their own weapons, and 'pickupable' weapons, ones taht you can pick up from the ground, are another thing entirely.

This Node is rotated by -90 degrees on the Y axis so the weapon model always points at the negative Z axis!
(NOTE: This might only be an issue because of the way the gun1 model was made?)"
